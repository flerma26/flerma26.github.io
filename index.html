     <h2>What I have learned</h2>
   <p class="coding">
     I have learned to code two important languages in Programming:CSS and HTML.
     These languages have helped me complete exercises, and build my own website.
     This makes me feel more secure when working with websites, and more knowledgeable on the realm of programming.
     Below is my favorite exercise from CodeHS.
